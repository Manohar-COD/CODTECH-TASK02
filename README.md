The Student Grades Tracker is a Python program designed to help users manage and track student grades efficiently. This project allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display additional information such as the corresponding letter grade and GPA.

# Key Features

1. Grade Input:
   - Users can enter multiple grades.
   - Input validation ensures grades are between 0 and 100.

2. Average Calculation:
   - The program computes the average of all entered grades.

3. Letter Grade Assignment:
   - Based on the average, the program assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).

4. GPA Calculation:
   - Converts the average grade into a GPA on a 4.0 scale.

5. User-Friendly Output:
   - Displays total grades, the list of entered grades, the average, letter grade, and GPA in a clear format.

# Program Structure

- Functions:
  - `calculate_average(grades)`: Computes the average of the grades.
  - `get_letter_grade(average)`: Determines the letter grade based on the average.
  - `calculate_gpa(average)`: Calculates the GPA corresponding to the average grade.

- Main Functionality:
  - The program prompts the user for grades in a loop until they decide to finish.
  - It handles errors gracefully, providing feedback for invalid inputs.
  - Finally, it summarizes the results in a user-friendly manner.

# How to Use the Program

1. Run the Program: Start the program in a Python environment.
2. Input Grades: Enter grades one by one and finish by typing `done`.
3. View Results: After input, the program displays:
   - Total number of grades
   - List of grades entered
   - Average grade
   - Letter grade
   - GPA

# Benefits for Beginners

- Simplicity: The program's straightforward structure makes it easy to understand for beginners.
- Hands-On Learning: Users learn how to handle user input, perform calculations, and manage data in Python.
- Extensibility: Beginners can easily expand the program by adding new features, such as saving grades to a file or implementing a user interface.

This project serves as an excellent introduction to programming concepts while providing practical functionality for grade management.
